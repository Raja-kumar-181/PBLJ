1)Easy Level: Write a Java program to implement an ArrayList that stores employee details (ID, Name, and Salary). Allow users to add, update, remove, and search employees.

2)Medium Level: Create a program to collect and store all the cards to assist the users in finding all the cards in a given symbol using Collection interface.
